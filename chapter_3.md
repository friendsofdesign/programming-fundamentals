# Why JavaScript?

We will be focusing our attention on JavaScript. Why have we chosen JavaScript as the base for this course?
Simply put, JavaScript is used extensively on almost all websites and apps.

JavaScript is a weakly­typed/loosely­typed, Object­oriented language, allowing the developer to work directly
with all website/app elements (i.e. tags, classes, id’s) like objects and data. JavaScript also allows you to
create actions or responses based on events. It is a very complete scripting language that contains all the
same elements that modern languages like C# contain.
