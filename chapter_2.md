# What is Programming?

Programming is the logical process an application or website will follow
expressed in code. With code we speak directly to the app or website. This code
becomes the logic by which an application or website adheres to ­in other words,
code will instruct the application or website how to behave based on what is
being done or engaged with.

In the development industry, the logic of a program or system is referred to as
"Business Logic" ­this is a representation in code, of how the business system
will conduct the logical process of the company's business model or service. In
the video game industry it may be regarded as “Game Logic” ­ the logic of how the
game will be played. All applications, electronics, and websites will have logic
driving the functions of the program.

As mentioned there are many languages that can be used to code the logic of a
game, application or website. Each language has it’s own differences in syntax,
expressions, conditions, operands and methods that it will be used by a
developer/programmer to build up the logic of the app or system.

It is common place in the industry to find "Use Cases", these are documents
which outline how the application, game or website will be engaged with by the
users. Often users fall into two categories, public and administrative. Systems
can also be categorised as either public facing or internal.

A business system that allows employees at a business to perform many functions
of a company will be regarded as an internal system. Websites which provide a
service to the general public is obviously a public facing system. However there
are many systems that handle both.

> **Example:**
>
> A blogging/online media company is using a CMS for a blog site, it is both
> public facing and internal. The system is composed of two major sections each
> fulfilling different roles. The internal system allows admins to write, post,
> update and delete articles. While the public facing section allows site
> visitors to read the articles, sign up and bookmark articles. The system logic
> will thus dictate which type of user has access to each section as well as
> providing the functions each user type has to their disposal.

We will primarily concerning ourselves with programming for websites. However it
is just as important to grasp the logic of programming for a small site with
simple functions, as it is to understand the complexity of large system. The
logic and programming will remain the same at it’s core. If you grasp the
fundamentals you will be able to learn other programming languages quickly as
well as easily read and understand them.
