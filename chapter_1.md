# A Brief History of Computers & Programming Languages

The first computer to be programmed was invented by Charles Babbage in 1822. It was called the Difference Engine
 (Ferguson, 2000). It was a crank driven mechanical calculator, it’s purpose was to calculate tables of polynomials
 for use in industries like engineering, aeronautics and the military. By providing inputs an manipulating gears in
 the machine they could produce these mathematical tables (i­programmer.com, 2013). Unfortunately for Charles Babbage
 he did not live to see the completion of his computer. This process of inputting commands into a mechanical computer
 to provide instructions evolved over time into many variations, punch­cards, pins & holes and finally programmatic
 languages. In 1890 the Hollerith Card Tabulating Machine was created to assist the U.S. Government with collating
 census data (Cockford, 2011).

In 1942 the E.N.I.A.C. was built by the U.S. Government and it allowed for the first use of programming in an
 electrical computer. By rewiring and setting switches, the computer could be programmed to complete specific
 calculations (wikipedia, 2015).

1957 saw the arrival for the first programmatic language FORTRAN (Formula Translating System). Designed
 and created by IBM, it was used mostly for scientific purposes. It was the first language to introduce states
 and conditional statements like IF, DO, and GOTO (Ferguson, 2000). Over the last 40 or so years, many
 programming languages have come into existence, COBOL, LISP, Algol, Pascal, BASIC, C, C++, and JAVA to name a few. These languages have built on the logic providing more methods, operands and data­types for developers to work with, again increasing productivity and efficiency of writing code.

J.C.R Licklinder of MIT (Massachusetts Institute for Technology), wrote the original plans for the internet in
 August, 1962, he called it the “Galactic Network”. ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency) later known
 as DARPA, created the first version of this network called ARPAnet (Gosselin, 2011). Access to ARPAnet
 was restricted by the U.S. government primarily to academic institutions, scientific research and the military.
 It took 20 years for the ARPAnet to become publicly available to personal computers and businesses (Gosselin, 2011).
 Finally taking on the mantle as we know it, the Internet.

The Internet was invented by Robert Elliott "Bob" Khan and Vinton "Vint" Gray Cerf in the late 1980s (Kahn &
 Cerf, 2015). While at DARPA they worked closely on ARPAnet and were ultimately responsible for creating the
 protocols which allow data and computers to interact with each other across the internet. In 1990 and 1991 while
 working at CERN, Tim Berners­Lee created what would become known as the World Wide Web, as way to simply access
 documents across their network (Gosselin, 2011).

The growth and expansion of the internet into business and homes, lead to the need for GUIs to be developed.
 This need was met in with the creation of web scripting languages like JavaScript, which was first released in
 1995 (Gosselin, 2011).

New programming and web scripting languages are consistently being created for various applications and industries.
 Existing web languages too are evolving, HTML for instance is in it’s fifth release version (HTML5), and has a
 number of variations like JADE or HAML.
