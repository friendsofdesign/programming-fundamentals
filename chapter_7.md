# Reference Docs

Keep these links nearby, you will need them at some point. Due the vast number
of methods, functions, datatypes, objects, events, etc. it is not common that
any developer will completely know the full scope of any programming language,
thus it common place for all developers to “check the reference docs” from time
to time.
