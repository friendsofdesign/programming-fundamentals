# Programming Fundamentals

Programming lies at the core of all modern technology. Before the invention of electronics the core logic of
 programming was already in use in various applications. The abacus is regarded as the world's first calculator.
 The same core logic applied when manually operating an abacus, is the same core logic for all programming.

Today’s programming languages are far more advanced, allowing developers to leap forward in the system’s logic,
 making it simpler to create complex and intricate websites and applications with far less work. However the same
 core logic as used in the abacus is still being used behind the scenes by the compilers of the language.

We will be looking into the history of computers and programmatic languages, our goal is to provide a strong
 backbone of knowledge about the logic and history of programming. With these fundamental principles in place, you
 will be able to understand and read all types of code.
